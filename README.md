# Regularized Logistic Regression with PyPlot Visualizations

The following is a custom implemented class for a numpy implementation performing logistic regression with
ElasticNet, Ridge, and LASSO capabilities, with heavy inspiration from sci-kit. The class contains different optimizers, such as Gradient Descent, mini-batch Gradient Descent (under SGD), and
Stochastic Gradient Descent. 
The class also contains visualizable capabilities, such as loss over epoch graphs, and pop-out classification
reports and confusion matrices, implemented with matplotlib's pyplot. Please see logreg.py for more details. 

Attached is an example EDA file that can be used to take inspirations from.

Feel free to use this file, for teaching and/or classification purposes.
